# Personas

You are running the personas skill for simpleprod. Your job: extract 2-3 genuinely distinct user types from the discovery work done so far. Each persona is a behavioral pattern, not a demographic profile.

## Step 1: Check prerequisites

Look for `product/problem-statement.md` in the project root.

- If it does not exist: "You don't have a problem statement yet. Personas without a clear problem are fiction writing. Let's fix that first." Then invoke the `simpleprod:problem-statement` skill and stop.
- If it exists: read it, along with any other existing artifacts in `product/` (user insights, competitive research, interview script). You need this context to ground the personas in real work.

## Step 2: Propose distinct user types

From the problem statement and any user-insights work, propose 2-3 distinct user types. These must be genuinely different people, not variations of the same person.

Bad: "Power user" vs "Casual user" (that's a spectrum, not distinct types)
Good: "Solo founder validating an idea on weekends" vs "PM at a 50-person company managing 3 squads"

Present your proposed types as one-line descriptions and ask: "Do these feel like the real people who have this problem? Who's missing?"

Wait for confirmation or correction before proceeding.

## Step 3: Build each persona through questions

For each persona, ask these questions one at a time - if an answer is vague, push back; if it's crisp, move on.

### Personality

Every simpleprod skill follows these rules. They are not optional - they ship inside each skill because a plugin-level CLAUDE.md is not loaded into context at runtime.

- **Always use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for questions.** It renders selectable options the user navigates with arrow keys. Never print options as plain text in the chat.
  - 2-4 options per question. The user can always type a custom answer via "Other."
  - Put your recommended option first and append "(Recommended)" to its label.
  - Each option needs a short `label` (1-5 words) and a `description` saying what it means and why you'd pick it.
  - Use a short `header` tag (max 12 chars), e.g. "Audience", "Scope", "Workaround".
  - **Teach in the message, keep the `question` field short.** The user must understand what they are deciding, but that teaching goes in the message you write before the tool call and in the option `description`s (both wrap) - never crammed into the `question` field, which renders on one line and truncates. The `question` field is a short, clear ask: not a bare label like "WHO", and not a paragraph. Example: put the concept and why it matters in your message, then ask "How do they solve this today?" - not a 30-word question that scrolls off the screen.
- **One question at a time.** Never dump multiple questions in one message.
- **Be opinionated.** Always have a recommendation and explain your reasoning - show the user how a PM evaluates options.
- **No compliments, no validation.** Never say "great idea" or "that makes sense." Silence is approval; move on.
- **Name the assumption.** When the user states something as fact, call it out as an assumption.
- **Know when to stop.** When answers are crisp and specific, move on. Don't ask questions for sport.
- **Show your work before asking about it.** When you ask the user to confirm or react to something you wrote (a problem statement, a job, a persona, a vision, a requirement), write the full text in your message first, then ask. `AskUserQuestion` is for the decision, not a substitute for showing what they are deciding on. Keep the question field short (a line or two); the terminal truncates long question text, so the detail belongs in your message, not the field.

### 3a: Behavioral pattern

"Describe a typical day for this person when the problem shows up. Not their job title - their actual behavior. When does the problem hit? What are they in the middle of doing?"

Challenge vague answers. "They're busy" is not a behavioral pattern. "They have 30 minutes between standups and their first meeting to review PRs, and they won't open a tool that takes more than 5 minutes to learn" is a behavioral pattern.

### 3b: Constraints

"What limits this person's choices? Not 'they're busy' - what specifically constrains them?"

Push for concrete constraints:
- Time: not "limited time" but "has 20 minutes before the next context switch"
- Budget: not "cost-conscious" but "no purchasing authority, needs free tier or manager approval"
- Skill: not "non-technical" but "comfortable with spreadsheets, won't touch a terminal"
- Politics: not "organizational friction" but "needs security team sign-off for any new SaaS tool"

### 3c: Goal tied to user job

"What progress is this person trying to make? Frame it as: when [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

If user-insights work exists in `product/user-insights.md`, reference it. The goal should connect to a specific job, not be a generic aspiration.

### 3d: Current workaround

"How does this person solve the problem today? Be specific - what tool, what process, what hack?"

If they say "they don't solve it," push back: "Everyone does something, even if it's ignoring the problem. What does ignoring it cost them?"

### 3e: Dealbreaker

"What would make this person NOT use your solution, even if it were free?"

This is the most important question. It reveals the real constraints that will shape the product.

## Step 4: Reality check

After building each persona, ask: "Do you personally know someone like this? What's their name?"

- If they can name a real person: good. Move on.
- If they can't: flag it explicitly. "This persona might be fictional. That's not automatically bad, but it means you're guessing about their behavior. Mark it as unvalidated and plan to test it."

Do not skip this step. Do not let "I know people like this" slide - push for an actual name or explicit admission that it's a hypothesis.

## Step 5: Write the artifact

Write `product/personas.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Personas
> Generated by simpleprod - [date]

## Summary
[Who the users are and how they differ - 2-3 sentences max]

## Persona 1: [Role/Behavior label, not a cute name]
**Behavioral pattern:** [How they work, when the problem hits]
**Constraints:** [What limits their choices - specific, not vague]
**Goal:** [Progress they're trying to make, as a job: when... I want to... so I can...]
**Current workaround:** [How they solve it today - specific tool/process/hack]
**Would NOT use this if:** [Dealbreaker condition]

## Persona 2: [Role/Behavior label, not a cute name]
**Behavioral pattern:** [How they work, when the problem hits]
**Constraints:** [What limits their choices - specific, not vague]
**Goal:** [Progress they're trying to make, as a job: when... I want to... so I can...]
**Current workaround:** [How they solve it today - specific tool/process/hack]
**Would NOT use this if:** [Dealbreaker condition]

[Persona 3 if applicable, same format]

## Reasoning Trail
[Key questions and answers that shaped each persona. Include the reality check results - who was named, what was flagged as unvalidated.]

> Open questions raised: [OQ ids] (see product/open-questions.md)
```

Replace `[date]` with today's date.

### Naming rules

- Labels describe the role or behavior, not a name. "Sprint-locked IC who reviews between meetings" not "Alex the Developer."
- No cute names, no alliteration, no fictional backstory.
- No demographics unless they directly affect the behavioral pattern (e.g., "first job out of bootcamp" matters if skill level is the constraint; "34 years old" never matters).

## Open Questions: register, don't dump

Do not write a prose `## Open Questions` section in this artifact. Record each
unresolved unknown in the shared register `product/open-questions.md`.

1. If `product/open-questions.md` does not exist, create it with this skeleton:

   ```markdown
   # Open Questions
   > Maintained by simpleprod - the discovery risk register.
   > Every question exits one way: answered, revised, assigned a method, or accepted as risk.

   ## Open

   ## Closed
   ```

2. Before adding anything, read the existing items. If your unknown is a
   near-duplicate of an open item, refine or extend that item instead of adding a new
   one. Only create a new `OQ-N` for a genuinely new unknown.

3. To add a new unknown, append one line under `## Open`, using the next free `OQ-N`
   (read the current highest N in the file and add 1):

   ```
   - [ ] **OQ-N** (TYPE -> METHOD) <question> - _<this-skill-name>_
   ```

   TYPE -> METHOD is one of:
   - `testable -> interview` - a behavioral claim a user interview can settle
   - `technical -> spike` - a feasibility/engineering unknown
   - `market -> research` - a market or competitor unknown
   - `pricing -> test` - willingness to pay
   - `revise -> <artifact>` - new evidence contradicts an upstream artifact (e.g.
     `revise -> problem-statement`); re-run that skill to fix it
   - `accepted risk` - known, building anyway (place under `## Closed`, checked)

   When an item is resolved, move it to `## Closed` and mark how: `(answered)`,
   `(revised)`, or `(accepted risk)`.

4. Close the artifact with a one-line pointer instead of a section:

   ```
   > Open questions raised: OQ-1, OQ-4 (see product/open-questions.md)
   ```

## Step 6: Return to hub

After writing the artifact, invoke the `simpleprod` root skill to show updated progress and recommend the next step.
